## Review

#### Project Purpose

Snacking review website.

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Used Cloudinary
  * Used this feature to upload pictures of product
* Bootstrap
  * For theme of website
* Node JS/Express
  * Used to implement logic and routes

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Awesome choice of setting up a rating system and separating the admin and user
* Easy to review and rate snacks
  * There is a rating system that allows us to review the snack score. Very easy to review
* Very simple layout and easy to navigate
  * I knew exactly where to go to review a snack. For example if I am not login or registered, the sign will easily redirect me to a register page.

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Dropdown menu edition:
  * When in a particular snack item page, the drop down menu of selecting which snack to review is not necessary.
* Add more CSS:
  * could add more css such as color


## Additional Notes
* great that you are still planning to implement more development such as the snack avg score system so people will know what are the ratings.
*  Area of development extra:
  * could add categories for snacks
  * a like button can also be implemented for each review
